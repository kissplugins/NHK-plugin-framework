# KISS Smart Batch Installer - Project Log

## Recent Development Session (Last 24 Hours)

### Overview
Major debugging and progress tracking improvements to resolve installation failures and provide better visibility into the installation process.

### Key Issues Addressed

#### 1. Installation Failure Investigation
- **Problem**: Plugin installations were failing with generic error messages
- **Root Cause**: Multiple potential issues including GitHub API access, download URLs, and WordPress upgrader problems
- **Investigation**: Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the installation pipeline

#### 2. Progress Visibility Enhancement
- **Problem**: Users couldn't see what was happening during installation process
- **Solution**: Implemented real-time progress updates in the debug panel
- **Benefit**: Now shows step-by-step progress from security verification through plugin activation

### Technical Improvements

#### Backend Enhancements
1. **Enhanced Debug Logging**
   - Added detailed error logging in `PluginInstallationService.php`
   - Improved error messages with specific failure points
   - Added GitHub API response logging

2. **Progress Tracking System**
   - Created progress callback mechanism in installation service
   - Added progress updates to `AjaxHandler.php` for all installation steps
   - Progress data included in all AJAX responses (success and error)

3. **Installation Pipeline Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling in plugin installation process
   - Better GitHub URL validation and HTTPS enforcement
   - Improved memory management during installation

#### Frontend Enhancements
1. **Debug Panel Integration**
   - Enhanced existing debug system to handle progress updates
   - Created `window.sbiDebug.addEntry()` for consistent progress logging
   - Real-time progress display with appropriate status icons

2. **AJAX Response Processing**
   - Modified installation handlers to process progress updates
   - Better error message display with troubleshooting information
   - Improved user feedback during installation process

### Progress Steps Now Tracked
1. Security Verification (nonce and permissions)
2. Parameter Validation (repository name/owner)
3. Repository Verification (GitHub accessibility)
4. Download Preparation (URL generation)
5. Plugin Download (file retrieval)
6. Plugin Installation (extraction and setup)
7. Plugin Activation (if requested)

### Files Modified
- `src/API/AjaxHandler.php` - Progress tracking and enhanced error handling
- `src/Services/PluginInstallationService.php` - Progress callbacks and detailed logging
- `src/Admin/RepositoryManager.php` - Debug panel integration
- `assets/admin.js` - Progress update processing

### Current Status
- Progress tracking system implemented and functional
- Debug panel shows detailed installation steps
- Still investigating root cause of installation failures
- Enhanced error messages provide better troubleshooting information

### Next Steps
1. Analyze debug output from failed installations
2. Identify specific failure points in the installation process
3. Address GitHub API or WordPress upgrader issues as needed
4. Continue improving error handling and user feedback

### Debug Features Added
- Real-time progress updates in debug panel
- Comprehensive error logging with timestamps
- GitHub API response tracking
- Memory usage monitoring during installation
- Step-by-step installation process visibility
